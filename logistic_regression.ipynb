    "\n",
    "Welcome to your Third assignment! You will train a logistic regression model to distinguish cat pictures from dog pictures. In this assignment, we'll practice such process under a binary classification context. \n",
    "- A binary classification task is to categorize an object into one of the two classes. \n",
    "- In deep learning, we usually extract some features (remember used car's age and mileage?) from the object and employ a neural network model to predict which class this object belongs. \n",
    "- Unlike the previous assignment, we'll use all pixels in an image as the features. And the duty of the NN model is to predict the image's category based on it's high-dimensional features. \n",
